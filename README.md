### Portfolio Project: NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis
## Tools used :
- PowerBi Desktop
- Power Query
- PowerBi Service
#### **Project Overview**

This portfolio project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle collisions in New York City between **2012 - 2024** to provide actionable insights into the causes and impacts of these incidents. The data, visualized using Power BI, highlights trends, contributing factors, and the effects on different categories of road users, such as motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. By interpreting these visuals, I aim to propose data-driven recommendations that can guide future city planning, policy development, and road safety measures.

### **Key Sections**

#### **1. Objectives**
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To identify the top contributing factors to motor vehicle collisions.
- To analyze the impact on vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians.
- To observe collision trends over time and interpret significant fluctuations.
- To provide recommendations that can help reduce collisions and improve overall road safety.

---

#### **2. Dataset Overview**
The analysis uses police-reported collision data from New York City. The dataset includes the following key elements:
- **Collision contributing factors**: Lists the top reasons for collisions, such as driver distraction or failure to yield.
- **Victim impact**: Categorizes injuries and fatalities for different road users (motorists, cyclists, pedestrians).
- **Collision trends**: Yearly changes in the number of reported incidents from 2012 to 2024.

##### **3.1 Top Collision Contributing Factors**
A bar chart visualizes the five main factors responsible for motor vehicle collisions in NYC:
- **Driver Inattention/Distraction**: 427,037 incidents
- **Failure to Yield Right-of-Way**: 126,412 incidents
- **Following Too Closely**: 113,900 incidents
- **Backing Unsafely**: 78,157 incidents
- **Other Vehicular Factors**: 65,925 incidents

###### **Insights:**
- Driver distraction is the most significant cause of collisions, far exceeding other factors.
- The presence of multiple behavioral factors suggests that many collisions could be prevented through education and enforcement.

###### **Recommendations:**
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Focus on the dangers of distracted driving, particularly related to mobile phone use.
- **Stricter Law Enforcement**: Increase fines or penalties for tailgating, failing to yield, and unsafe driving behaviors.
- **Intersection Design Improvements**: Modify road infrastructure at high-risk locations, such as adding more visible signage, better lighting, and roundabouts to prevent collisions.

##### **3.2 Impact on Vulnerable Road Users**
A breakdown of injuries and fatalities shows the following:
- **Cyclists**: 43,000 injured, 185 killed
- **Pedestrians**: 74,000 injured, 842 killed
- **Motorists**: 357,000 injured, 1,000 killed

###### **Insights:**
- Pedestrians are the most vulnerable group, with high injury and fatality rates.
- Cyclists also face significant risk but have fewer fatalities compared to motorists and pedestrians.

###### **Recommendations:**
- **Infrastructure Enhancements**: Build protected bike lanes and pedestrian pathways to reduce interactions with motor vehicles.
- **Pedestrian Safety**: Implement better street lighting, pedestrian bridges, or dedicated crosswalk signals in high-traffic areas.
- **Traffic Calming**: Use speed bumps and traffic circles to slow vehicles in areas with heavy pedestrian and cyclist activity.

##### **3.3 Collision Trends from 2012-2024**
A line chart presents the percentage change in collision incidents across several years:
- Notable increases and decreases:
  - **2013**: -30.58% reduction in collisions
  - **2014**: +106.08% increase in collisions
  - **2015**: -48.72% reduction
  - More modest fluctuations from 2016 to 2024, with a notable decrease of -10.63% in 2022.

###### **Insights:**
- Significant fluctuations indicate external factors influencing collision rates (e.g., policy changes, economic conditions, or seasonal effects).
- The drastic rise in 2014 followed by a sharp decline in 2015 suggests a temporary but impactful variable.

###### **Recommendations:**
- **Historical Review**: Investigate key policy changes, road conditions, or events between 2014 and 2015 that may have driven these shifts.
- **Sustaining Declines**: Review and potentially replicate the successful interventions from 2015 and 2022, focusing on what contributed to significant reductions in collisions.

---

#### **4. Recommendations and Next Steps**

Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

##### **Data Deep Dive**
- Further analysis is needed to pinpoint the reasons for sharp fluctuations in collision rates (e.g., in 2014 and 2015). Investigating factors like law enforcement policies, road construction, or significant events could help refine recommendations.

##### **Infrastructure Improvements**
- NYC should prioritize developing more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly infrastructure. Protected bike lanes, improved pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming measures will help reduce the high injury and fatality rates in these vulnerable groups.

##### **Behavioral Interventions**
- Educational campaigns focused on raising awareness about the dangers of distracted driving should be promoted citywide. Programs that encourage drivers to avoid using mobile devices and other distractions can significantly reduce collisions.
- Reinforce enforcement on issues like tailgating and failure to yield through technology (e.g., red-light cameras and speed enforcement).

##### **Ongoing Monitoring**
- Track future collision data (2023 and beyond) to assess the effectiveness of any implemented interventions. Utilize data to guide adaptive strategies for future road safety improvements.
